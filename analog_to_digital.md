# Assignment 3 - Analog to Digital

- Complete the [Vidiot analog synthesis tutorial](./vidiot_tutorial) in the digital arts studio. You can see the current schedule for the Digital Arts Studio (Fuller Labs FLA17) [here](https://sched.cs.wpi.edu/month.php?year=2020&month=1&day=23&area=1&room=15) and then reserve it by writing an email to Varun Baht (I'll post his email in the Slack.) Make a reservation for two hours to complete the tutorial.

- While you're completing the tutorial, take pictures / videos of visual results that you like, and be sure to take notes on *how* you acheived them. Take pictures of the Vidiot patch / knob settings. This documentation is required for the assignment submission.

- Implement at least seven Vidiot features in a fragment shader, using the [HTML template provided for this class](./webgl_template.htm). Ideally, you will implement features that enable you to realize the results you found interesting while doing the Vidiot tutorial. Some Vidiot features to implement include:
    1. (Mandatory) Sine oscillators for modulation. The [notes from day 1](./notes.day1.md) give a good introduction to this.
    2. Brightness control
    3. Luma inversion
    4. Luma Keying
    5. RGB controls 
    6. Audio input (microphone)
    7. Video input (webcam)
    8. Noise generator
    9. Square wave oscillator
    10. Triangle oscillator
    
- Create a 1–2 minutes composition using your fragment shader; ideally it should be inspired by your experimentation with the Vidiot. 

- Write a paragraph (150–200 words) that describes your aesthetic intent and what you were interested in exploring technically. Relate it to your work with the Vidiot and show relevant still images or video clips that you took.

- Play your animation for a classmate (this can be coordinated via Slack). Write a paragraph that describes the feedback of your classmate and whether or not it matched your expectations... and of course it's totally fine if it doesn't match them (and possibly much more interesting!). Feel free to include feedback from addition classmates / other people if you like, but only one source of feedback is required.

- Create a webpage containing a link to your video (hosted at a permanent location such as Vimeo or Youtube), your shader code (this can be a link to a GitHub file or you can inline it on the page), your summary paragraph, the images/video clips you took from your session with the Vidiot, and the paragraph about the feedback you received. Add a link to this webpage from your personal course website (and make sure you've done the pull request in the onboarding assignment if you haven't already). 

- Due January 30th by the start of class.

Grading Rubric
---
- 10% Posted to your personal course website correctly, with video in permanent hosting location
- 10% Summary paragraph concisely explains technical and aesthetic goals
- 10% Paragraph describing feedback received and how it met / didn't meet your expectations
- 50% Implementation of Vidiot features / website
- 10% Development of piece... how does it change over time? Is their a peak?
- 10% Visual Aesthetics. Is there a discernible theme in the work? What constraints are in place (limited color-palette, limited number of shapes etc.)? 

This assignment will count for 10–12.5% of your final grade, depending on whether we do four or five assignments in the course. Please take time to ensure that spelling / grammar are correct and that the assignment is linked / posted / hostted correctly so that you don't lose any easy points.
